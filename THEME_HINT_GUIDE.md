# Theme Hint Feature Guide 🌟

Your website now includes a subtle **theme hint indicator** that helps new visitors discover the theme toggle feature!

## ✨ What is the Theme Hint?

The theme hint is a small animated indicator that appears for **first-time visitors** to draw attention to the theme toggle button. It helps users discover that they can switch between dark and light modes.

## 🎯 How It Works

### **For New Visitors:**
1. **Page loads** - Website starts in dark mode (default)
2. **2-second delay** - Gives users time to see the page
3. **Hint appears** - Animated indicator shows for 5 seconds
4. **Hint disappears** - Automatically fades away
5. **Never shows again** - Hint is marked as "seen" in localStorage

### **For Returning Visitors:**
- **No hint shown** - Since they've already seen it
- **Theme preference preserved** - Their saved theme is used

## 🎨 Visual Features

### **Desktop Hint:**
- 🌟 **Sparkles icon** with "Toggle Theme" text
- 🎯 **Animated badge** that scales and rotates
- ⬇️ **Arrow pointer** that bounces up and down
- 💫 **Pulsing ring** around the theme toggle button

### **Mobile Hint:**
- 🌟 **Same sparkles icon** and text
- 📱 **Positioned for mobile layout**
- ⬇️ **Arrow pointing to mobile toggle**

### **Animations:**
- **Scale animation** - Badge grows and shrinks
- **Rotation animation** - Gentle swaying motion
- **Bouncing arrow** - Points to the toggle button
- **Pulsing ring** - Highlights the button itself

```
