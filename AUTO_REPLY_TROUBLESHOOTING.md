# Auto-Reply Troubleshooting Guide

If you're not receiving auto-reply emails, here are the steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue.

## 🔍 Immediate Checks

### 1. **Check Spam/Junk Folder**
- Auto-reply emails often go to spam initially
- Check your spam folder for emails from Web3Forms
- Mark them as "Not Spam" to improve future delivery

### 2. **Wait 5-10 Minutes**
- Auto-replies can take 1-5 minutes to be sent
- Sometimes longer during peak hours
- Don't worry if it's not immediate

### 3. **Check Web3Forms Dashboard**
- Go to [web3forms.com/dashboard](https://web3forms.com/dashboard)
- Look for your recent submissions
- Check if auto-replies are being sent

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Updated Field Names**
I've updated the code to use the correct Web3Forms field names:
- `'auto-reply'` instead of `auto_reply`
- `'auto-reply-subject'` instead of `auto_reply_subject`
- `'auto-reply-message'` instead of `auto_reply_message`

### 2. **Added Required Fields**
- Added `'h-captcha': 'false'` to disable captcha
- Added proper `from_name` and `replyto` fields

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. **Test Contact Form**
1. Submit a test message through your contact form
2. Wait 5-10 minutes
3. Check your email (including spam folder)
4. Check the sender's email for auto-reply

### 2. **Test Newsletter**
1. Subscribe to your newsletter with a test email
2. Wait 5-10 minutes
3. Check your email (including spam folder)
4. Check the subscriber's email for welcome message

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Web3Forms Dashboard Configuration
1. Go to [web3forms.com/dashboard](https://web3forms.com/dashboard)
2. Find your form settings
3. Enable auto-reply in the dashboard
4. Configure auto-reply templates there

### Option 2: Manual Auto-Reply Setup
If the code-based auto-reply doesn't work, you can set up auto-replies manually:

1. **Gmail Auto-Reply**:
   - Go to Gmail Settings
   - Set up "Vacation responder" or "Auto-reply"
   - Create filters for specific email subjects

2. **Email Client Auto-Reply**:
   - Use your email client's auto-reply feature
   - Set up rules for emails containing specific keywords

### Option 3: EmailJS Integration
If Web3Forms auto-reply continues to have issues, we can switch to EmailJS:

```bash
npm install @emailjs/browser
```

Then implement direct email sending with auto-replies.

## 📊 Debugging Information

### Check Browser Console
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Submit a form
3. Look for any error messages
4. Check the network tab for API responses

### Check Web3Forms Response
The response should include:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Form submitted successfully"
}
```

If you see errors, they'll help identify the issue.
